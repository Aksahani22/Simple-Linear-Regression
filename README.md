# Simple-Linear-Regression
### This repository is based on Linear regression, Predicting the count(demands) of bikes based on different features(variables)

* Repoository consist of 
  1. Jupyter Notebook 
  2. Subjective and General question-answers [pdf file]
  3. Rented Bike Data set [csv file]
  4. Readme.md fil
  
* Jupyter notebook consist complete process such as
  1. Data Cleaning
  2. Data Analysis
  3. Data Pre-Processing
  4. Data Modeling
  5. Model Assumption
  6. Preediction
  
 * In Order to run this application we need few python libraries such as
   1. Numpy        (For array manupulation)
   2. Matplotlib    (Graph and plots)
   3. Pandas        (DataFrame Library)
   4. Sklearn       (For building Linear Regression Machine learning Model)
   5. statsmodels   (For Assumption)
